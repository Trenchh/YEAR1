"""
A testing module for Assignment 2

This module contains some functions for testing a solution to Assignment 2.
If this module loads without error and the testAll() function reports no errors,
it does NOT guarantee that your solution is 100% correct.  What it does mean is:
    - You've got the structural details right: name of module,
      names of functions, and number and order of function parameters
    - Your functions work correctly for the test list used in
      this module
      
For marking your submissions, we may change or add to this testing code and we
will definitely use different test lists, including larger ones than the
example used here.  So we may uncover errors in your code that
this module didn't catch.  You would be wise to invent more test cases for
yourself.  As an example, for your sorting function you should try lists of
different sizes with elements in different orders (already sorted, reverse
order, almost correctly sorted, etc)
